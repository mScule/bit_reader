Write file that contains binary values. Drag and drop this file to the bit_reader.exe,
and it creates "a" file from the binary values.

FILES

  You can give the file source by writing the path to the file into the arguments.

  -o, or --output and after that the desired output filename.

CHANGE THE ENDIANNESS

  If you want to switch the endianness use
  -e, or --endianness and after that the desired endianness.
  Supported keywords are "big", and "little".
